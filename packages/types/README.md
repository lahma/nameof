# @typescript-nameof/types
This package provides type declarations for the use of the [`@typescript-nameof`](https://github.com/typescript-nameof/nameof) packages.

## Installation
Install this package using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/nameof@npm:@typescript-nameof/types
```

Take note that this package is installed as if it were named `@types/nameof`.
This is made because TypeScript will only automatically pick up types from packages that are named `@types/*`.
You could actually use any name you like to as long as it starts with `@types/`.
